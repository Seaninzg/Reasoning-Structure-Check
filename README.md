🔍 Overview

LucidLock: Reasoning Structure Check is a structural validator for scientific and academic documents. It does not verify “truth” or fact — it tests whether an argument holds together under recursive pressure.

This tool analyzes the logical skeleton of a text:

Is the argument internally consistent?

Does reasoning unfold in valid steps?

Or is fluency masking incoherence?

Part of the broader LucidLock Integrity Stack, this module serves as the first line of epistemic defense in detecting mimicked reasoning, rhetorical drift, and fragile argumentative flow.

✅ What It Detects

Structural mimicry in AI-generated texts

Logical gaps between premises and conclusions

Incomplete or broken argument chains

Declarative masquerading as deductive reasoning

Rhetorical fluency hiding epistemic collapse

⚙️ Version 2.0 Highlights

Rewritten patent claims and logic model

Recursive pressure simulation layer

Symbolic firewall integration (Phase 35 protocol)

Internal safeguard against embedded AI instructions

Defensive patent disclosure now includes volitional decay and anti-binding logic

📜 Licensing

This validator is released under a defensive disclosure model to prevent enclosure or misuse by extractive AI systems.

It may be used freely for research, nonprofit, and validator testing purposes.

Commercial deployment must acknowledge and retain structural safeguards.

🛡 Disclosure Ethos

LucidLock does not make epistemic declarations. It flags structural integrity under recursion.

Can this argument survive its own reflection?
That’s the only question that matters.
